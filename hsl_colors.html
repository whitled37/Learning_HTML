 <h1 style="color: rgb(68, 0, 255)"> HTML-HSL and HSLA Colors</h1> 
 <p> In this module I learned that hsl and hsla color values are similar to the rbg and rbga values with the changing of colors. However, the hsl/hsla values use perentage values. HSL stands for hue,saturation, and lightness. HSLA stands for hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha (opacity). This is also used in the rgba color value in that you can adjust the transparency of colors. I like both the saturatiion and lightness technique because it gives me more control as well as options with how precise i want to be when choosing a color. I can literally play around with the shades.   </p>
