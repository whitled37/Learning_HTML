  <p>I learned that with rgb I can hover over the tag and change the colors. If i use rgba, which is the alpha aka opacity, I can change the transparency of the color. In hex colors there is not much difference except when changing the colors you can interchange between the letters or numbers first. For example, #ff4567 or #43ee34. If you want to use the different shades of grey you have to repeat the numbers. For example #454545. </p>
